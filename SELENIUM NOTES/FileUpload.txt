Selenium does not support desktopApplications so we have to integrate selenium with Auto IT.
Installation steps:
1. Go to Official website to download AutoIT
site:
https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/
2. click download auto it first option after scroll down
3. After downloading Auto IT setup exe file, install and just click next next....
4. After installation go to "c" drive open programfiles x86 and inthat open autoIT folder
5. To open AutoIT Editor folder open SciTE folder and click on 
   SciTE application i.e our editor.


FileUpload AutoIT script:
Steps:

1. Shift focus from webapp  to desktop window
2. set complete file path in Edit text box
3. click on open

To deal with desktop components we have to write windows Object it is same like webelement

To Identify windows Object go to C drive open Programfiles x86
click on AutoIT--> open--> Au3info_X64 It is used to find window Object

How to Identify Window Object?
1. Open Au3info_X64
2. drag Finder Tool on desktop element and look for title ,class ,intance values
3. Write Auto IT script in editor

To Shift Focus we have to write ControlFocus("title","","controlId")
here title u can find  Au3info_X64 and
controlId is Class+instance

To write filepath  in edit box for  upload file
ControlSetText("title","","controlId","filepath")

To click on open
ControlClick("title","","controlID")

ControlID: class+Intance

Sample AutoIT script
ControlFocus("Open","","Edit1")
ControlSetText("Open","","Edit1","D:\selniumfiles\seleniumProgramNotes\ExplicitWait.txt")
ControlClick("Open","","Button1")

save this and right click and compile as X64 it will generate
.exe application

this .exe application will pass in selenium script

Selenium script:
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "D:\\selniumfiles\\chromedriver96\\chromedriver.exe");
	WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
	driver.get("https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/word-to-pdf.html");
	Thread.sleep(3000);
	driver.findElement(By.id("lifecycle-nativebutton")).click();
	Thread.sleep(3000);
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec("D:\\selniumfiles\\seleniumProgramNotes\\autoItScripts\\FileUpload.exe");  // code is completly java and package is java.lang


AutoIT script:
ControlFocus("Open","","Edit1");
ControlSetText("Open","","Edit1","D:\selniumfiles\manualnotes\new Manual notes\blackboxtechniques.docx");
ControlClick("Open","","Button1");
