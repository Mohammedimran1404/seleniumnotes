Alerts:
1. What is Alert?
If we do click action on WebElement then any popup
apears that is known as Alert.
2. How many types of alerts?
   1. Java script alert
   2. Browser Alerts(Browser Authentication)
3. How to Handle Java script alert?
   a. switch control to alert by using below line
      driver.switchTo().alert();
Here driver WebDriver Object
switchTo() method
alert() method

then it will return Alert type-->Reference
therefore: Alert alert=driver.switchTo().alert();

Alert is Predefine Interface
Package: org.openqa.selenium.Alert

can we inspect alert elements
example: buttons ,text, text box?
No we cannot inspect

How to do actions on alert components?
to click on OK button in Alert Interface we have accept() method
to click cancel we have dismiss() method
to get alert msg we have getText() method
to write in alert textbox we have sendKeys() method


Summarry:
1. switch control to alert--> Alert alert= driver.switchTo().alert();
2. to click "ok" button use accept() -->alert.accept()
3. to click "cancel" button use dismiss()-->alert.dismiss()
4. to write in "textbox" use sendKeys()--->alert.sendKeys()
5. to get "alert msg" use getText()-->alert.getText()

Important points:
1. <a href="/basic_auth">
Basic Auth
</a>

When we inspect any element and found <a> tag
then choose locator as linktext
here text is "Basic Auth"

2. How to Copy Xpath?
after inspecting on highlighted tag just do right click and copy-->copy xpath

<a href="/basic_auth">Basic Auth</a>
 
 1. If we inspect and find tag name is "a" tag  then choose locators as linktext
    linktext=Basic Auth
    
 2. If we inspect and found open tag and close tag then choose locator as 
      Xpath with text method
      syntax:
      //tagname[text()='middletext']
       //a[text()='Basic Auth']

Automating Windows Controls with selenium:

Handling Window Authentication Popup.

Two Types Of Pop ups:
1. Javascript Popup (driver.switchTo().alert())
2. Windows Authentication popup( it is linked with browser cannot handle with alert() and we cannot inspect elements in this type of popup)


Sample WebSite Link:

https://the-internet.herokuapp.com


We can handle window popup by using  modifying webdriver url.

Syntax: http://username:password@siteURL

Inside driver.get()  use above syntax automatically it will login .

Example: 
driver.get( " http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com ");
