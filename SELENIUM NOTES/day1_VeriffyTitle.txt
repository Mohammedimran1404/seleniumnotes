    and select classpath
e. click on Add external jar files
f. it will navigate to your local system
d. select jar file from your local system
g. click on open -->and click on apply and close.

Note: if On project red cross symbol is there It means
      in program there is a compile time error .
       If On Project red ! --> symbol is found then the jar files
       Which is added that is not suitable for Ecllipse
       then download other version. 

1. Verify title of amazon page

1. Launch chrome browser
2. Open Amazon URL
3. Get current page title and consider as actualTitle
4. compare actualTitle with expected title
5. closebrowser

WebDriver interface

Implemented classes
ChromeDriver
EdgeDriver
FirefoxDriver

Parent object=new Child();
Child object=new Child();



WebDriver driver=new EdgeDriver();
                         reference Object
WebDriver is a predefine interface
Package: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver

EdgeDriver is predefine implemented class
Package: org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver

Purpose: 
WebDriver driver=new EdgeDriver();--> Launch Empty Edge browser


****Note:
When we write only one statement
i.e WebDriver driver=new EdgeDriver();
and execute the program will face below runtime error

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.edge.driver system property; 

Will face same issue for different scenario:
a. if we do not set the path for EdgeDriver
b. if we set the path but still same error occurs it is because might be webdriver.edge.driver spelling is wrong

What is webdriver.edge.driver?
It is constant parameter used to set the path

c. path of EdgeDriver might be not having .exe extension
example:
expected path: 
"D:\selniumfile\chromedriver97\chromedriver.exe"
actual found is:
D:\selniumfiles\chromedriver97

d. may be path which is given it is not found in location

e. if we copy mam system path.


How to set the path?
1. gotothe palce where you have downloaded and save chromedriver.
2. open the folder and do shift right click on EdgeDriver.exe  and click  the copyaspath
3. come back to eclipse program
  inside main 
before
WebDriver driver=new EdgeDriver();
write below statement
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","D:\selniumfiles\EdgeDriver\EdgeDriver.exe");

change single slash to double slash because java will not allow single slash.

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","D:\\selniumfiles\\chromedriver97\\chromedriver.exe");

Now run the program it will launch EdgeBrowser.


Second step:
How to open URL?
To open URL in selenium webdriver we have two methods
a. get()
b. navigate().to()

get():
purpose: to open URL
Type of method: -+ without returntype with parameter
Parameter: String type i.e url
Nature of method: non static
How to call non static method ? by Object name
Object is created for class
Class name :EdgeDriver
Interafce : WebDriver
call method by using webdriver object 
i.e driver.get("http://www.amazon.in");


Third step:
get title of current page

Method: getTitle()
Purpose: to get current page title
Type of method: +- with returntype without parameter
returntype: String (current title)
nature of method: non static
How to call non static method? by object name
Object is created for class
Class name: EdgeDriver
Interface: WebDriver
call method with webdriver object name
String actualTitle=driver.getTitle();


Fouth step: compare actualTitle with expected title
Assume expectedtitle as "amazon"
and use now java if else logic to compare
and here we comparing two string so we use equals() method
String expectedTitle="amazon";
if(actualTitle.equals(expectedTitle))
   syso("Testscript pass");
else
syso("Testscript fail");

FifthStep: close browser
To close browser 
method: close()
driver.close();


Assignment: verify URL
1. Assume expectedURL
2. Launch Browser
3. open URL
4. Get current URL consider as actualURL
5. compare actualURL with expected URL
6. close browser

Hint: to get current URL use method getCurrentURL()
it is defined inside ChromeDriver,WebDriver and it is non static and it return string type.
