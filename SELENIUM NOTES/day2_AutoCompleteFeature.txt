Enter Product name in search box

Enter Action(writing)
Product  name (test data)
Search box (place or component where we have to write)

Search box is a component on WebPage
so we called as webPage component
in selenium we called as WebElement

Task : How to identify Search box WebElement?

We can identify WebElement by using locators

In selenium we have following locators by using that we can write webelement and we can perform action on it.
a. id
b. name
c. classname
d. linkText
e. xpath
f. css
g.tagname

id,name,classname are directly found in HTML tag as attributes.

How to identify locator?
1. go to webpage , on particular component do rightclick
  and click inspect,HTML page will open
Highlighted line is design for that particular component.

front end is design by using tag languages

<> open tag
</ >closetag

<> open

<   /> open close

example:

<input type="text" id="twotabsearchtextbox" value="almonds 1kg pack offer low price" name="field-keywords" autocomplete="off" placeholder="" class="nav-input nav-progressive-attribute" dir="auto" tabindex="0" aria-label="Search">

input is html tagname
type id value name.....html attributes
in that we need to look for id or name or class

locator:
id="twotabsearchtextbox"

How to write locator in selenium?

In selenium we have Predefined class called By
Package : org.openqa.selenium.By
inside By class we have all static methods
By amazon_searchbox_locator=By.id("twotabsearchtextbox");


How to find WebElement in selenium?

In selenium we have predefined methods:
a. findElement  --> used to find single element
b. findElements ---> used to find multiple elements

findElement is a non static method
class: ChromeDriver interface: WebDriver
findElement is with returntype with parameter
returntype: WebElement(it is predefined interface used to store webpage components)
parameter: By type

WebElement amazon_searchbox_element=driver.findElement(amazon_searchbox_locator);


amazon_searchbox_element.sendKeys("Dates");

sendKeys is method to write in search box,text box,text area
it applied only on webelements

To do Keyboard action on inspected element we have to use keys class
inside keys class we have all static functions

Keys.Arrow_DOWN
Keys.Enter

the above key functions we have to use as a parameter in send keys

amazon_searchbox_element.sendKeys(Keys.Arrow_DOWN);
