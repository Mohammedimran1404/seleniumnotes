For Multiple frames Program Which is thought in class we required four html pages
a. frame_a.html 
b. frame_b.html 
c. frame_c.html 
d. frames.html

*** do not open frame a,b,c pages
1. right click on frames.html -->openwith --->notepad--> then html code will open
2. shift right click on frame_a.html --> copy as path
3. come back to frames.html code inside frame tag src= paste the path
4. similarly follow the steps for b,c frames donot remove any attribute from frame tag
just paste the path in src= 


Xpath with single attribute:
syntax:
//htmltagname[@attributename='value']


Example
<input type="text" id="001">
//input[@id='001']

Xpath with multiple Attributes:

syntax:
//htmltagname[@attributename='value'][@attributename='value']

example:
<input type="text" id="002">

//input[@id='002'][@type='text']

Css Selector

syntax:
htmltagname[attributname='value']

example:
<input type="text" id="003">
input[id='003']


Frames Concept:
Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//input[@id='001']"}

Above Exception Will comes in few situations:
a. may be locator is wrong(mistake in writting)
b. locator is correct but still browser is not reacting to that element
   then change the locator
c. time issue
   Program will execute very fast it will not wait for fraction of second but browser sometimes takes time to open application.
d. if inside a page frame tag is there or
  element on which we want to do action it is inside frame tag.

What is frame?
Frame is a HTML tag
It is used to divide the single page into sections
and in this section multiple html pages will be loaded


How to work with elements which is inside frames tag?
 switch control to frame then only we can work with elements.

How to switch control to farmes?
We can switch by using driver.switchTo().frame();

In how many ways we can switch control frames?
3 ways
a. driver.switchTo().frame(int ) //here int is index value and frame index  starts with 0
b. driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement )
//here inspect frame tag and write WebElement by using this webelement we can switch
c. driver.switchTo().frame(String )
here String is (inspect frame tag in that  value of  "name" attribute value.)

Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchFrameException: no such frame

If we want to switch control from one frame to another farme 
first switch to default content and then switch to next frame.
(means we have to come out of that frame then switch to new frame)

driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
