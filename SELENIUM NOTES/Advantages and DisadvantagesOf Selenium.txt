Advantages of Selenium:

2. Selenium supports various programming languages to write programs (Test scripts)
   example: java,C#,perl,python,Ruby and PHP

Disadvantages of Selenium

1. No reliable Technical Support from anybody. because it is Open Source
2. It supports Web based applications only.
3. Difficult to use, takes more time to create Test cases.
4. Difficult to Setup Test Environment when it compares to Vendor Tools like UFT, RFT, SilkTest etc…
   Selenium uses various tools and plugins to support Test Automation, we need to configure them manually.
5. Limited support for Image Testing.
6. New features may not work properly.
   Since it is open source software nobody is responsible for new features usage, they may or may not work properly.
7. No Test Tool integration for Test Management.
   No Tool available in the Selenium’s Tool suite to support Test Management, we have to choose any tool from the market
8. No Built-in Reporting facility.
   Selenium WebDriver doesn’t have built in Result Report facility, we need to take help from either JUnit or TestNG Testing Framework to genrerate Test Reports.
