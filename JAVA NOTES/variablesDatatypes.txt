What is variable?
A variable is a location name where information is stored.

What is information?
Information is data it can be Alphabets , numbers , special characters

Can we store any type of data in location?
yes we can store any type of data means number,alphabets,special charatcers,decimal numbers
therefore there is no restrictions u can store any type of data in location.

What is the problem if we do not restrict data to store in a location?
Example:
lets add two numbers
store number1 i.e 10 in location a--> a=10
store number2 i.e 20 in location b--> b=20
store result after calculating in location c--> c=a+b
no error found because we can add two numbers

but if we enter input as other than number , example it can be alphabet or special character
therefore we cannot add number with alphabets or special character
then we have to face unexpected results or errors
to overcome this we need someone who cross verify data before storing into location.

** To cross verify the data we have to use Datatypes.

What is Datatype ?
a. Specifies memory size
b. what type of values that can  be stored into memory location.

Example Student Info:
Name : Anvesh--> Group of alphabets --> String
age  : 20--> integer
Email: Anvesh123@gmail.com--> alphabets+numbers+specialcharacters-->String
marks: 999--->integer
per  : 99.9-->decimal number--> float , double
grade: A --> single alphabet or single digit or single special character---> character
Higher studies: yes  no
                true false -->  boolean

integer
float
double
character
boolean

String


What is Keyword?
A purpose of the word already define
         byte
         short
integer  int
         long
float    float
double   double
character char
boolean   boolean


"String"  it is not a keyword
String is predefine class

Datatypes is divide into two types
1. Primitive type of data
2. Non Primitive type of data

1. Primitive type of data it is  also known as built-in data types or intrinsic datatype

Primitive type of data is divided in two types
a. numeric: 1. Integer 2. floating point
b. non numeric: 1. characters 2. boolean 

** Primitive datatype are not user define i.e Programmers cannot develop.

 java defines eight primitive data types:
         byte
         short
         long
integer  int
float    float
double   double
character char
boolean   boolean


*** 8 primitive type of data is divided in to 4 groups

1. conditional category: boolean
2. character  category: char
3. Integer category: byte ,short ,int ,long
4. Float category: float,double

** All datatypes are Keywords, they are in small letters

Non Primitive type of data :
It is also known as derived datatypes or reference datatypes
a. class
b. Array
c. Interface
d. Object
e. String

** In Primitive type of data we can store only one value at atime , it known as general or fundamental types of data.

** non primitive data types known as  advanced datatypes stores group of values.
** basic datatypes: integer floating point,character,string boolean
*** Data types are used in java because java is a strongly typed language.     
Java compiler checks type compatibility
    illegal operations cannot be compiled.

What is declaration,initialization?

Declaration tells about
a. What is the location name (i.e variable name)
b. What type of data it can store

initialization defines What information we stored in location.

Syntax:
datatype variablename=value;

datatype variablename ---> declaration

variablename=value---> initialization

String name="Avnesh";
int    age=20;
String email="avensh123@gmail.com";
int marks=999;
float per=99.9f;
float per=99;
double per=99.9;
boolean HS=true;
char grade='A';

Rules for writing variablename:

** variable name is userdefine but follows below rules.

a. variable name must start with alphabets
   uppercase : acceptable warning ex: Marks
   lowercase : valid  ex marks
b. do not start with numbers or specialcharacters
   ex: 9marks=100 --> invalid
       *marks=100--> invalid
        marks9=100--> valid
        
c. do no contain spaces 
   ex: total marks=420;---> invalid
       totalMarks=420; valid
       total_marks=420; valid
d. do not use keyword as variable name
   char int='A';   invalid
  char is datatype  valid
int is consider as location name   invalid ---> int is a keyword
'A' data  valid

 char ch='A';
