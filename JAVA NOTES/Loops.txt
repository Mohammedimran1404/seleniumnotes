/*
 
 Syntax:
 initialization;
 while(condition)
 {
 logic;
 updation;
 }
 */
/*
 1. if while condition is true then control will go inside while and execute the logic
    and updation and process repeate till condition false
 2. control will go to condition after updation ,control will not go to  initialization during repeatation.
 
 3. What happen if we do not initialize the variable?
     if we only declare and do not intialize no compiletime error in that line but
      we can see compile time error in the expressions or conditions or where ever we use that variable
      
      error msg: The local variable n may not have been initialized
      **Note: A variable can declare without initialization but cannot use without initialization

 4. while()--> it will accept only boolean type of data and expression
     inside while if we write directly true then loop will execute infinite times
     inside while if we write directly false then compile time error will be raised because control will not reach to while body.
 error msg:  Unreachable code

 5. Can i write semicolon after while condition?
    yes we can write semicolon no compile time no run time error but  below part 
    i.e body of while does not come under while condition 
    because while terminates in same line
    Two types of output:
  a.   program will not terminate if while condition is true (it will itirate in it self only)
  b.   program will terminate if while condition is false 
    and because of semicolon while control finished in the sameline 
    and below part comes under normal program
    
  6. What happen if we do not write updation?
  no compile time error but program will go infinite times if condition is true
  otherwise terminate
  
  7. What happen if we write updation as decrement but according the program it needs increment?
       no compile time error but program will not terminate go infnite times.
       
       giving updation is not important giving correct updation which breaks condition at certain point is must.

** In for loop if we write semicolon then no compiletime error and no runtime error
