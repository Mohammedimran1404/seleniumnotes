How to call methods Outside class?
First:
a. check access modifier or specifier
      access modifier will tell us that is method visible or not outside class, in package or outside package
           within class        outsideclass           outsideclass
                               with in package        outside package
public        yes             yes                     yes
private       yes             no                      no
protected     yes             yes                     no
default       yes             yes                     no

b. check method is static /non static

If method is static call with class name inside package
If method is static call with class name and import package.class  , outside package


If method is non static call with Object name inside package
If method is non static call with Object name and import package.class  , outside package
