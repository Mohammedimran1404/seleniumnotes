If we initialize the variables directly in program
means setting input values is known as hard code.
Hardcode means we cannot altered(change) input values without
modifying the program.

How to give different input everytime without modifying program?
Java is Providing predefined class called Scanner
With the help of Scanner class methods we can enter input values while running the progarm
it means no need initialize the value in the program (no need to do hard code)

About Scanner class:

Class name : Scanner
Purpose: Read or scan input data ,through keyboard we can enter the input data
Type of class: Pre defined (in built)
Methods : 
int   nextInt()
float nextFloat()
double nextDouble()
boolean nextBoolean()
**To scan String data we have two methods
a. next()  b. nextLine()

next() method will scan all characters but not space
Example:
if input is "Afsara Samreen"
next() method will scan only "Afsara"
here space is the ending character


nextLine() method will scan all characters and allow space also
Example:
if input is "Afsara Samreen"
nextLine() method will scan "Afsara Samreen"
here Enter key is end character

next() will scan  one word without space
nextLine() will scan morethan one word with space

*** To scan character i.e char type of data we do not have any method inside Scanner class, then how to scan 
char type of data?

Here to scan char type of data we need to take help
from String class
Inside String class we have a Predefined methods
method: charAt(int )

behaviour of charAt(int )
charAt() method will return only particular position (index) value.

example: 
AFSARA
012345
go and get character value at index 2 = S--> charAt(2)

to scan only one character value we have to use charAt() method along with next() or nextLine()
next().charAt(0)
here next() allows u to enter group of characters
and charAt() will get only one value from the entered characters.

example: 
input :
AFSARA_SAMR E E N
012345678910111213
next().charAt(6)--> _
next().charAt(14)-->Run time error String index out of bounds Exception

If we want to scan only space then use
nextLine().charAt(0)

Nature of methods: non static
memory allocation will be at Run time if we create object then only we can access the methods

Steps:
1. create Object
2. import package in which  Scanner class is define
3. call methods using object name

Create Object:

Classname objectname = new Classname(ifparameters);

Scanner   scan      = new Scanner(System.in);

Scanner is a classname
scan is userdefined object name
new is a keyword to allocate memory
System is a predefined class
in is inputstream it is a static function
input data is supplied using keyboard

** always when we use any prdefined class then we have to import package

import java.util.Scanner;

here import is a keyword
      java.util is package name in which Scanner class is define

call method bu using object name
scan.next()
scan.nextInt()
