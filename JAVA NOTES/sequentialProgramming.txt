Sequential Programming:
Sequential is step by stepexecution of program
here each and every line will execute.

1. To solve any problem what information is requried is known as input.
2. After calculation result is known as output

Problem : find area of rectangle:

To find area of shape rectangle
input : dimensions i.e length,width
input type: integer--> int

int length=10; // here int is datatype length is variable name  10 is data
int width=5; // here int is datatype width is variable name  5 is data
int area= length*width;//here area is a variable name of int type which will store multiplication value  of length*width

If we want to print only text write inside double quotes
it means whatever we write in double quotes exactly it will display

to display variable value we should not use double quotes.
if we write variable in double quotes it will not consider as variable , it will consider as text.


to join two strings or string and variables we have to use
"+" operator here + symbol will not perform addition operation
it will perform concatenation operation means joining two things

"Hello " + "World"

"Hello " +"Welcome to slenium class"
"Area of Rectangle "+ area // Area of Rectangle 50

Assignment -1
1. Find Area of Circle:
   formula: area = pi*r*r

2. Find Circumference of Circle
   formula : circum= 2*pi*r

here r is radius

3. find totalmarks and percentage:
   totalmarks=m1+m2+m3+m4+m5+m6
   percentage= totalmarks/6

here m1 to m6 are 6 subject marks

4. calculate SimpleIntrest
   si= p*t*r/100

here p=principle amount  t=time   r=rateof intrest
