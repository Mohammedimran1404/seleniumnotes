1. When ever we call any method first find out what type of method it is , second where we are calling methods means inside which block.

Method will be two types
a. static method 
b. non static method

Block will be two types
a. static 
b. non static

Example:
In Type1 Program
method addition is static method
we want to call addition method inside main method
main method is static method(static block)


***If method is static and a place where we are calling that method or block is static then call with
a. classname.methodname() // anywhere in project
b. methodname() // only inside class


** When we call any method control move to method defination once defination execution finish control come back to same place from where we called a method.

** static members belongs to class

Example:
Type1NS-->Class
Inside Type1NS class we have a method addition which is non static.

in method signature if we do not find static keyword that method known non static.

How to call non static method inside static methods or blocks?

addition()--> non static and we are calling in main method which is static

call with Object name,
non static method or variables get initiated at Run Time.
so we to have call by using object name.

How Object is created?
syntax:
classname objectnam= new classname();
example:
Type1NS    obj=new Type1NS();

Type1NS obj--> compiler
new Type1NS () --> run time Object -->JVM

Now call methods by using objectname
example: obj.addition();

What if we try to call non static members inside static?
compile time error we will face
i.e static reference we cannot make to non static feilds or methods
