What is Operator?
Operator is a symbol that is used to perform particular actions or Operations.
example: + - > <

Why we have to learn Operators in Programming?
to do mathematical calculations
to check conditions
to perform logical operations.

How many types of Operators?
1. Arithmetic operator
2. Relational operator
3. Logical operator
4. unary operators
    logical not
    increment/decrement
    negation
5. terenary operator or conditional or if else
6. Assignment operator
7. Bitwise operator
8. shift operator
1. Arithmetic operator:
purpose: to perform mathematical calculations
operators list: 
       addition              +
       subtraction           -
       multiplication         *
       division--> quotient   /
                   remainder  % modulo

Above five Arithmetic operators is divided into two types
High priority * / %
Low priority  + -

Here * / % have equal priority but when compare to + - it is having high priority

Here + - have equal priority but when compare to * / % it is having low priority

Evaluation : left to right


Examples:

2+3*5

In a given experession check how many types of operators are there 
here only one type i.e Arithmetic operator
inside Arithmetic operator here we have + *
so * is having high priority

2+3*5
2+15
17

Note: high priority operator is evaluated first and then second low priority.

(2+3)*5
here braces is having high priority  When compare to all operators
5*5=25


2*4/2

2*2=4 invalid

8/2=4 valid

if expression is having all same priority operators then we to choose evaluation left to right.

2+3-1
5-1=4  valid
or
2+2=4  invalid

2+3=5--> in Maths
c=a+b
here a,b operands 
       c result variable
      + = operators
       operation
+ Performs Addition and = performs Assignment action.


Relational Operator:
purpose: to check condition or to campare LHS and RHS value or to find relation between two values or operands

When : when we have to check only one condition.

Scenario 1:
Example Gmail Signin
username :
              next

business logic:
if user click next button read username from client side(UI) and  compare with database username
if matches move to next page otherwise display invalid username.

here on click we are verifying just a single username feild in this case we have to use Relational operator.


Scenario 2: 
I Purchase a laptop price : 65000
  Im reselling it price: 70000

sellingprice > costprice = profit


Operators List :

greater than                    >
greater than or equalto         >=
lessthan                        <
lessthan or equalto             <=
doubleequalto                   ==
not equalto                     !=

Above six operators are divided into two categories
a. high priority :  > >= < <=
b. low  priority : == !=


Evaluation : left to right
output type of data:  boolean either true or false

** When compare to  Relational operator Arithmetic operator is having high priority.(2+3>5)

Examples:

2>2 false
2>1 true
2>3 false

2>=2 true
2>=1 true
2>=3 false

2<2 false
2<1 false
2<3 true

2<=2 true
2<=1 false
2<=3 true

2==2 true  
2==1 false

2!=2  false
2!=1  true

What is difference between sigle equalto = and double equalto ==?
= Assignment operator it is used to store data from RHS to LHS int a=100;
== Relation operator it is used to compare both LHS and RHS value. a==100

Combination of Arithemetic and Relation Operator:

2+3*5>3*3+5<2+2*5==5!=0
2+15>9+5<2+10==5!=0
17>14<12==5!=0
  1 <12==5!=0
    1==5!=0
      0!=0
        0
        false
here true means 1 false 0 in calculation


int a=10;
boolean res= a=10;  error
