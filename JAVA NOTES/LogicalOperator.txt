Logical Operators:
* Logical operators is used to check morethan one condition
or
to combine more than one condition
or to evaluate morethan one condition

Operators List:
AND  &&
OR   ||
NOT   !

AND operator:
This operator result or return true if all conditions are true.
If even one condition is false then final result will be false.

Symbol: &&

Example:
notice board:
100     200   Room1
201     300   Room2
301     400   Room3
401     500   Room4

HT: 355

100  200  room1
HT>= 100 && HT <=200
355>=100 && 355<=200
true          false  = false

201  300  room2
HT>= 201 && HT <=300
355>=201 && 355<=300
true          false  = false
301  400  room3
HT>= 301 && HT <=400
355>=301 && 355<=400
true          true  =true

And Examples:
1<x<10
x>=1  && x<=10

x=5
5>=1  &&  5<=10
true       true
      true

Explanation: Here we have two condtions to check and operator is &&
means if first condition is true then control
will go two second condition then result depends on second expression.

x=12
12>=1 && 12<=10
  true  && false
       false
here firstcondition is true then control move to second condition and second condition return false therefore result is false

x=0
0>=1 && 0<=10
false
here first condition is false then control will not move to second condition 
output is false.

Summary:
And logical operator will return true if all conditions are true.

first it will check firstcondition if it is true then control move to second condition
and result(output) depends on second condition
other wise if first condition is false output is false, it means control will not go to second condition.


OR Operator(||):
This Operator returns true when one of the two condition is true.

OR operator return true if atleast one condition is true.

if all conditions are false then output is false

Example:
age>=18 and

(election voter ID  or

Adhaar card or

Pancard)


x==10 || x>=15

x=10

10==10 || 10>=15
 true

Here there are two conditions and operator is OR means if any one condition is true overall result is true

** In OR Operator if first condition is true
   control will not go to second condition


x=12

12==10 || 12>=15
  false    false = false
first condition is false then control move to second condition then result depends on second condition here in above example second condition is false 
therfore output is false.

x=20
20==10 || 20>=15
 false ||  true  = true

here first second condition is false then control move to second condition and second condition is true then output is true.


Logical Not (!): 
Not ! operator is known as unary operator

unary means action performed on single operand.

example :
if we want to use + operator we need two values  ex: 2+3  a+b

if we use "not operator" action is performed on single variable or value (i.e boolean)

behaviour of not operator:
if condition is true it will convert to false
if condition is false it will convert to true


examples:
2>3=false
!(2>3)=!false=true.

!true=false
!false=true

****** Unary operator will have high priority when compare to all operators.
