What is data hiding?
Data Hiding is hiding internal data from outside users. The internal data should not go directly that is outside person/classes is not able to access internal data directly. 

How to acheive data hiding?
It is achieved by using an access specifier- a private modifier.
The recommended modifier for data members is private.

Advantage of data hiding?
*** The main advantage of data hiding is security 

****It is used as security such that no internal data will be accessed without authentication. An unauthorized end user will not get access to internal data.

Example:

public class Bank
{
private float accountbalance=0;

String name;
long bankid;

public float getbalance(long bankid)
{
if(this.bankid==bankid)
     return accountbalance;
return -1;
}

public void setbalance(float balance,long bankid)
{
if(this.bankid==bankid)
{
accountbalance+=balance;
}
else
{
syso("invalid bank id");
}
}
}

public class Test
{
main()
{
Bank emp1=new Bank();
emp1.bankid=1234;
emp1.name="Samreen";
emp1.setbalance(10000,1234);
float balance=emp1.getbalance(1234);
if(balance!=-1)
{
display name bankid balanace
}
else
{
invalid id
}
}
}
