Loops:
Why we have to use loops?
To do same task multiple times we use loops.

How many types of iterative statements or loops?
a. Range Based Loop
b. Conditional Based loop

What is Range Based loop and When we have to choose?
If we know how many times statements has to execute in that case we use Range based loop.
Under Range Based loop: for loop.

What is Conditional loop?
When we do not know how many times the loop has to execute
it completly depends on condition 
In that case we use Conditional based loop.

Types of Conditional based loop:

1. Entry control loop: while loop
2. Exit control loop: Do While loop

Note: for,while, do while is used for same purpose.

Three statements are must inside any loop.
   a. Initialization (starting point)
   b. Condition      (Range)
   c. updation *** It can be increment/decrement/addition/subtraction/multiplication/division or any manipulation we can do only one condition that it has to break loop condition at certain point other wise loop can go infinte times.

About While Loop:

1. How to write while loop?
     syntax: Grammer
            initialization;
            while(condition)
            {
                logic;
                updation;
            }

2. How control will flow inside while loop?
    first control go to initiazation 
    second check condition : if condition is true then control move to inside while body 
    Third updation
 ****after updation control go and check condition and Process iterate till condition is false
Once condition is false control come out of while loop.
3. Do's Dont's of while loop:
    a. initialization is must
    b. while is a keyword it should written in lower case follow with round braces
         example while() valid one
                 While()  invalid one ---> undefined method
   c. inside round braces of while must write condition or any expression which results only boolean type of data
                  while(true) valid always loop execute never stop.
while(false) -->compile time error ---> unreachable code

while(2+3) --> compiletime cannot convert int to boolean (Type mismatch)
while(2+3>a) --> valid

d. after while should write semicolon.
     If we write semicolon there  are two types of behaviour:
             if while condition is true--->then loop will never ends no output on console , will not get terminated msg on console.(control iterates in same line)
                        int a=1, b=5;
                         while(a<b);
                          {
                                syso(a);
                                 a++;
                         }
      
             if while condition is false --> then will get output , no errors while below body part will execute one time
                        int a=1, b=5;
                         while(a>b);
                          {
                                syso(a);
                                 a++;
                         }
                            1 stop
